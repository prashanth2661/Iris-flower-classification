# Iris-flower-classification

This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica, based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which is widely used for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.

**Introduction**

The Iris flower dataset consists of measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on these measurements.

**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which can be found here. It contains 150 samples with the following features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
Species (setosa, versicolor, virginica)

**Usage**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Load the dataset and run the script to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

**Model Training**

The model is trained using a Random Forest classifier. The training process involves splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, training the model on the training set, and evaluating its performance on the validation set.

**Evaluation**

The modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using a confusion matrix, which provides insights into the accuracy and precision of the classification.

**Results**

The model achieves high accuracy in classifying the Iris species. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are printed to the console.
